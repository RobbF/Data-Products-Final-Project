The New MPG Predictor App
========================================================

For your ease of use, we have created a new app that allows you to gauge the affect of four separate predictors on a car's MPG. 

The predictors covered by this app are as follows:
- Displacement
- The weight of the car
- The 1/4 mile time of the car
- The car's gross horsepower

Using the App
========================================================

After selecting the chosen predictor with a simple dropdown menu, you will be immediately presented with a regression plot, like the following plot using a car's weight as the predictor:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dat = mtcars
plot(dat$wt, dat$mpg, pch = 16, cex = 1.3, col = "blue", , xlab = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", ylab = "MPG", main = "MPG vs. Car Weight")
                                        fit <- lm(mpg~wt, data = dat)
                                        abline(fit)
```

Where to Find the App
========================================================

Further Notes
========================================================
- The dataset used for this app is the Motor Trend Car Road Tests dataset, found in the basic 'datasets' library in R. 
- The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).
